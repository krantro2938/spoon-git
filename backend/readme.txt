Can you take a look at this repo and tell me where the most important api is like the route? https://github.com/calcom/cal.com

how would you propose to fix this issue: Date range header blinks repeatedly when navigating calendar views Issue Summary\nI noticed a UI bug in the date-range header on the scheduling calendar.\nWhen switching from weekly view to column view on the top right corner, the displayed date range keeps blinking between two different formats.\nWhat happens:\nThe date header alternates rapidly between:\n“Nov 24 – Dec 5, 2025”\n“Nov 24 – 29, 2025”\nThis blinking continues repeatedly.\nExpected behavior:\nThe date range should remain stable and correctly represent the selected calendar range without flickering.\nSteps to Reproduce\nOpen https://cal.com/anovoszath/60m?layout=column_view\nNavigate to a date range around late November 2025\nfrom \"switch to weekly view\" to \"switch to column view\"\nObserve the header at the top of the calendar\nNotice the date text flickers between two values\nActual Results\nThe date-range text at the top of the calendar keeps blinking repeatedly between two different ranges:\n“Nov 24 – Dec 5, 2025”\n“Nov 24 – 29, 2025”\nThis flickering continues each time the calendar loads or when switching between views.\nIt looks like two separate date calculations/render cycles are competing, causing the UI to alternate.\nExpected Results\nThe date-range header should show a single stable and accurate range for the currently selected calendar view.\nThe text should not flicker, change, or re-render repeatedly. Hint the component may be down the apps/web path. Here is the repo link - https://github.com/calcom/cal.com
